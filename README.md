# Simple Image Carousel

A beautiful and responsive image carousel built from scratch using vanilla JavaScript (ES2015), HTML5, and CSS3.

Features include:

* Animations created from scratch using keyframes, a new feature implemented in CSS3 that allows for creation of animations with more fine-tuned control.
* Responsive design for all devices.
* Navigation dots that show the current position of the image within the list of images.

To-do:

* Implement automatic navigation to the next image after 5 seconds have passed.
* Refactor CSS and JavaScript code.
